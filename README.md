# Decentralized House Renting System

The Decentralized House Renting System is a smart contract-based platform that revolutionizes the process of renting houses by eliminating intermediaries and providing a secure and transparent environment for landlords and tenants. This system utilizes blockchain technology to automate and enforce the rental process, ensuring trust, efficiency, and reduced costs. Named DeRent by team LoopBreakers, this was built as project for Soft CodeHack 1.0

## Features

1. **Property Leasing with Smart Contracts**: Tenants can lease a property directly from the landlord by entering into a smart contract. The smart contract enforces the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, ensuring transparency and automation.

2. **Account Freezing and Unfreezing**: The smart contract allows freezing and unfreezing of accounts in case of disputes, non-payment of rent, or violations of the lease agreement. This feature ensures fair and transparent resolution of conflicts.

3. **Contract Status Verification**: Landlords and tenants can verify the status of the smart contract, ensuring that all parties adhere to the terms of the agreement. The system provides a transparent and immutable record of the contract's execution and status.

4. **Security Deposit Management**: The system handles the management of security deposits securely. It ensures that security deposits are held in escrow and returned to the tenant at the end of the lease period based on the predefined conditions.

## Getting Started

To use the Decentralized House Renting System, follow these steps:

1. Install a compatible blockchain wallet, such as MetaMask, on your device.

2. Access the system's user interface through a web browser.

3. Connect your blockchain wallet to the application to interact with the smart contracts.

4. Explore available properties, review their details, and select a property for leasing.

5. Enter into a smart contract by accepting the terms and conditions of the lease agreement.

6. Monitor the status of the contract and make rent payments according to the predefined terms.

7. If disputes or conflicts arise, follow the account freezing and unfreezing process to resolve the issues transparently.

## Future Prospectives

The Decentralized House Renting System has immense potential for future development and enhancements. Here are some possible areas of improvement:

- Integration with decentralized identity solutions for enhanced identity verification and trust.

- Implementation of a reputation system to build trust among landlords and tenants.

- Integration with decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols for automated rent payments and escrow services.

- Integration with IoT devices to monitor property conditions and automate maintenance requests.

- Expansion to include additional features, such as tenant screening, background checks, and digital lease signing.
